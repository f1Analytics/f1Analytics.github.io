## Race Summary
The Saturday sprint race saw a surprising Ferrari competitive again.
While Leclerc never actually had the opportunity to counter attack the Red Bull of Sergio Perez, the monegasque managed to secure a second place that can boost the morale of the entire Italian team in view of the next races. The small break apparently renvigorated the prancing horse of Modena.

A bit underwhelming was instead the performance of Max Verstappen; while seemed pretty clear in the begnning that Red Bull could have grasped the usual 1-2 even in this Saturday, the current Wolrd Champion saw himself unable to even attack Leclerc. 
Christian Horner reported that the initial contact with Russell caused to the flying Dutch damages worth .75 seconds per lap, affecting both aerodynamics and heat dissipation of his car.

## Comments
- All laps under the regime of Safety Car are not taken into account.
- Lap times are interpolated and don't respect the _exact_ lap time, altough they remain quite significative. The analysis remains nonetless symbolic (many factors can affect the single lap time, like turbulence, dirty air, random wind gusts, minimal mistakes, battery charge, etc)
