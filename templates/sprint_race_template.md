## Comments
- All laps under the regime of Safety Car are not taken into account.
- Lap times are interpolated and don't respect the _exact_ lap time, altough they remain quite significative. The analysis remains nonetless symbolic (many factors can affect the single lap time, like turbulence, dirty air, random wind gusts, minimal mistakes, battery charge, etc)
